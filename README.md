Fuse-Depth-Maps<br />
The data set for training and prediction: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~harel/TAUAgent/home.html<br />
For training, need to build dataset by concatenate a three depth maps: mono, stereo and grond truth and save as .npy file. <br />
For infarance by pretrained model, need to change the path in file "prediction_depth.py" and run this file. <br />
Data set for test had attached by folder dataset. <br />
